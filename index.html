                  <p>
                    Immigrants have been a topic of contention in the U.S. since the arrival of Pilgrims back in 1607 Jamestown and still remains a controversial subject today. With this project, I wanted to examine how immigrants of the U.S. were protrayed in the media to evaluate the sentiments of the country during specific ranges of time. Throughout U.S. history, there has been several waves of immigration, often always of completely new nationality entering the country. In a piece by <b>History.com</b> titled "U.S. Immigration Before 1965," two of the blocks of mass immigrations occured between the time range of the documents provided by Chronicling America API, 1836 to 1922. These periods were 1815 to 1865 and 1880 to 1920, with one before the Civil War and the other after. The Civil War did contribute to the decrease in immigration. Due to the limitations of the API, I will start the range from 1836.

                  <span class="headline hl1">1836 to 1865</span>
                  <p>This was the first major wave of immigration to the U.S. following the Colonial period, and comprised mainly of newcomers from Northern and Western Europe, most of whom arrived from Ireland and Germany. The Irish many stayed along the East Coast near their point of arrivals, while the Germans moved to the midwest and purchased farms. A third major group to arrive to the U.S. during the mid-1800s were Asian immigrants, mostly Chinese, lured by the prospect of the California gold rush.

                  During this period of time, the influx of newcomers resulted in anti-immigrant sentiment among certain factions of America’s population, particularly with the native-born, predominantly Anglo-Saxon Protestant groups, as the new arrivals were perceived as unwanted competition for jobs, and the Irish Catholics were discriminated against for their beliefs. This was evident in the creation of the American Party, most colloqially known as the "Know-Nothings," which was anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic.

                  <span class="headline hl1">1880 to 1920</span>
                  <p>Following the Civil War, there was a period of rapid industrialization and urbanization, and America welcomed about 2 million immigrants, reluctantly. During this time period, Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was passed, banning Chinese laborers from coming to America.

                  <p>
                  While just after the range of documents available through the Chronicling American API, the Immigration Act of 1924 created a quota system that restricted entry to 2 percent of the total number of people of each nationality in America as of the 1890 national census — a system that favored immigrants from Western Europe and banned immigrants from Asia.
